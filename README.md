# EtherDFS-3
Fork of EtherDFS - The Ethernet DOS File System v0.8.2 by Mateusz Viste (https://etherdfs.sourceforge.net/).

This is a very special version of the DOS etherdfs client, for use with DOS 3.20 - 3.30 only.

EtherDFS is an 'installable filesystem' TSR for DOS. It maps a drive from a remote computer (typically Linux-based) to a local drive letter, using raw ethernet frames to communicate.
